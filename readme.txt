--=== 'Striation-UserMeta' - A Theme for Emulation Station ===--

Based on the wonderful and versatile Eudora theme by AmadhiX, Striation has four goals in mind:

	* Overall larger text for living room scale, widescreen displays
	* A simple and clean design with larger boxart and maximized metadata
	* As small a file size as I can manage!
	* A unique design for each system/platform (more below)

The name Striation comes from the patterns seen in nature from fault movement, but really it's just a cool word for stripes. My high concept for the theme is two-fold. As you scroll through the main menu of Emulation Station the logos displayed for each system resemble those found on the original hardware box. 

Selecting a system is then like opening that box with a background of stripey colors weighted to resemble the hardware and a logo to match. In many cases this means that the main menu logo and the system logo are different. I've found it enlightening and challenging to create many of these rarely seen variations but mostly I think it looks fantastic. If this is bothersome to you it's very easy to customize the images so jump down to the CUSTOMIZATION section below.

! !  NOW IN TWO EXCITING VARIETIES  ! !
Early on I had someone comment that they'd like to see the user metadata incorporated for 'times played', 'last played' and 'rating'. Thanks to that request there are 2 varieties of Striation, one with and one without the user metadata. Take your pick! They should be distributed separately so just look for "UserMeta" in the title.

--=== Layouts ===--

Like Eudora, I've done my best to match theme layouts with each system to maximize the boxart images. There are 3 types and they're also easy to customize depending on your region or needs. There's Portrait, Landscape and Landscape-SquareBox. The SquareBox version is great for platforms that had uniformly square boxes and gives the metadata some extra room to breathe. Unfortunately, most platforms require the Landscape layout since the boxes varied wildly between regions. If you're on a 4:3 display you'll also probably want to use the Landscape layout, things get pretty cramped otherwise.

Like Eudora, the rating, last played timestamp, and play count have been omitted from the base theme. I've had requests to enable them. We'll see how that goes, maybe in an additional release.



--=== Preview Image Size ===--

Again, like Eudora: you may wish to set your scraper to pull larger image files.  If you are using sselph's scraper, you can use the -max_width parameter to do this, matching the width of each system's layout.

Rough maximum sizes are as follows for each layout template:
Portrait:		400x600px
Landscape: 		600x400px
Landscape-SquareBox: 	600x600px



--=== Customization ===--

Say you only have Super Famicom games in your ROM folder or you've separated the Japanese Sega Mega-CD from its American cousin, the Sega CD. This will rule out the extreme variations in boxart so you can switch the layout of each system if you'd like. Just head into each system's folder located in:

	"themes/striation/SYSTEM_NAME/theme.xml"

and change the following line as desired:

	<include>./../common/templates/portrait.xml</include>

change it to portrait, landscape or landscape-squarebox


If my alternate logos bug you just change the filename in the same .xml file from "logoconsole.svg" to "logo.svg". This will match the logo on the main menu:

	<view name="basic, detailed">

	<!-- System Specific Images -->

		<image name="logo">

			<path>./logoconsole.svg</path>
